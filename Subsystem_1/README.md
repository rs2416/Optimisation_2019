## Subsystem 1 Code
### Author: Alfie Thompson
### Overview
This subsystem looks at the optimisation of a fishing kayak hull. Three methods are used to find optimal shape, starting from a simplified  analysis of hull dimensions and progressing to a more focused feature-based optimisation. A linear resistance optimisation was performed analytically, then a multi-objective optimisation analysis also took manoeuvrability into consideration. Finally, a manual genetic algorithm was performed using CFD to optimize possible features.

### Matlab
Matlab code has no requirements and the single file will output figures and results seen in the report.
This is to aid in the simplicity for marking.

#### Requirements
- MATLAB's Optimisation Toolbox

#### Structure:
1. Equations used throughout code
2. Benchmark value imput
3. Anaylitical anaylses
4. Non-linear solving
5. Comparisons
6. Thrust to velocity conversion

### CFD

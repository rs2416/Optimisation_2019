## Optimisation of a Fishing Kayak
#### Introduction
The aim of this project is to maximise the speed of a fishing kayak under human and motor power. Fishing kayaks are used to get out to remote lake and sea fishing locations and use motor power to get most of the distance, followed by a paddle power to get to the desired fishing locations almost silently.

The problem was split into four subsystems – hull design, paddle design, trolling motor and seat position. This allowed for a more in-depth analysis of different factors affecting the final output.

#### Outcome
The outcome of the first subsystem was the optimization of the kayak hull for a 8.9% increase in performance. Through the second subsystem an output average thrust of 58.8 N was received as the optimal value. The third subsystem found the maximum motor thrust obtainable to be 1820 N. The fourth subsystem took into consideration the relationship between seat height and paddling efficiency, as well as boat stability – the output was the optimal position of center of gravity equal to 0.14 m above waterline. Overall, on the system level the final speed of a fishing kayak was 3.0 m/s for human-powered and 10.0 m/s for motor-powered scenarios.
